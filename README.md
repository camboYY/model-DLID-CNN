# DLID-CNN Face Recognition (Research Repo)

This repo implements a DLID-CNN (Deep Learning Intra-class Difference CNN) for face recognition from scratch.

## Steps

1. Prepare dataset:

   - Place training images in `data/train/person_id/*.jpg`
   - Download LFW dataset into `data/lfw`

2. Train model:
   ```bash
   python train.py
   ```
# model-DLID-CNN
# model-DLID-CNN
